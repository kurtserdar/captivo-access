/**
 * CI guard: every `route.ts` under the non-request entry-point directories
 * (internal data-plane, cron jobs, connector enrollment/auth) must reference
 * a tenant-scope helper (`withTenantFrom`, `withTenant`, or `forEachTenant`).
 *
 * These endpoints do not run under the ambient request-tenant middleware, so
 * without an explicit scope call a handler can read/write across tenants.
 * This test walks the directories, greps each route file for the helper
 * regex, and fails naming any file that isn't scoped AND isn't on the
 * explicit allowlist below.
 *
 * If you are adding a new non-request endpoint that genuinely needs no
 * tenant scope (e.g. it touches no tenant data), add it to the allowlist
 * with a comment explaining why — do not just delete the assertion.
